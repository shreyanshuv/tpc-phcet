                    The PHCET Institution's Training and Placement Cell is an essential aspect. The PHCET management is
                    firmly
                    committed to maintaining the Training and Placement Cell and the opportunities it brings to college
                    students
                    by providing a solid infrastructure and human resources. College students' training and placement is
                    the main
                    goal of the Placement Cells. The institution hosts a variety of events during the academic year.
                    Students are
                    encouraged to take charge of developing their attitudes, soft skills, and opportunities to hone
                    their technical
                    and analytical talents. By exposing students to the workings of the corporate world, the Training
                    and Placement
                    Cell aims to provide them insight into their potential future employment.

                    The Training and Placement Committee (TPC) of Pillai HOC College of Engineering and Technology
                    assists desired
                    final year students to get suitable job after completion of their program. However, the training and
                    grooming
                    commences from the very first year. Spotting talent, classification, working on the strengths and
                    weaknesses of
                    students has been the hallmark of our endeavors. TPC conducts Training programs to enhance soft
                    skills and
                    overall personality of students in association with industry and academic experts.

                <p>
                    Invitation Letters/e-mails are sent to various companies, organizations for conducting campus
                    drives. The
                    internships are also provided to the interested students to groom them to become job ready. The
                    Students are
                    given occupational trainings such as communication skills, time management and stress management
                    skills to be
                    able to adapt to different work cultures and environments. The teachers also prepare the company
                    profile to
                    assist students to understand the work culture and job pre-requisites.
